### *Crafting Configurations Like a Barista*

Welcome to **Templatte**, where crafting configuration files is as delightful as brewing your favorite coffee.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Brewing Your Configurations

Get ready to savor the flavor of personalized configurations with just a sip:

```bash
pip install templatte
```

## üìú Menu of Brews
Choose your brew with finesse. Here's your barista command for a perfect cup:

Sure, here's the breakdown of each command in markdown:

### `deploy`
This command populates configuration template files by parsing the values specified in a `templatte.toml` file. It likely reads the `templatte.toml` file to extract key-value pairs and then uses these values to fill in placeholders or templates within configuration files, creating populated configuration files ready for use.

### `genelatte`
This command searches recursively for any configuration files (specifically TOML files for now) within the workspace. After finding these configuration files, it generates corresponding "latte" files, which could be templates containing placeholders or special markers for values. Additionally, it generates a `templatte.toml` file containing the values extracted from the original configuration files.

### `grind`
The `grind` command searches recursively for any "latte" files within the workspace and removes the original configuration files associated with them. This suggests a process where the original configuration files are replaced by their templated versions (`latte` files), likely to ensure consistency and avoid manual editing of configuration files.

### `pour`
This command deciphers or decrypts the values stored in the `templatte.toml` file using a passphrase provided as input.

### `press`
The `press` command cyphers or encrypts the values within the `templatte.toml` file using a passphrase. This is a security measure to protect sensitive configuration data. After encryption, the `templatte.toml` file can be safely stored or transmitted, ensuring the confidentiality of the configuration values.

1. **`genelatte`**: This command generates "latte" files and a `templatte.toml` file from existing configuration files found in the workspace. It does not directly depend on the output of any other command, but its output serves as input for the `deploy` and `grind` commands.

2. **`deploy`**: This command populates configuration template files by parsing the values specified in the `templatte.toml` file generated by `genelatte`. It directly depends on the output of the `genelatte` command, specifically the `templatte.toml` file and the "latte" files.

3. **`grind`**: This command removes original configuration files associated with "latte" files found in the workspace. It directly depends on the output of the `genelatte` command, as it operates on the "latte" files generated by `genelatte`.

4. **`pour`**: This command deciphers or decrypts the `templatte.toml` file. It depends on the output of the `press` command as it needs a preciously cyphered file to decipher.

5. **`press`**: This command cyphers or encrypts the `templatte.toml` file. It depends on the output of the `genelatte` command to have a `templatte.toml` file to encrypt.

## üö® Spills and Clean-Ups
- **Spill**: Template grounds lost.
  - *Clean-Up*: Double-check the path and ensure the format is as smooth as your espresso shot.

- **Spill**: Unexpected latte art in the output.
  - *Clean-Up*: Confirm the output options; the latte art should be delightful, not unexpected.
